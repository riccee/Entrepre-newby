As the project grew in complexity, I realized the importance of collaborating with others. I had the opportunity to work closely with Dorcy, a software engineer at Gnosis Freight, who provided valuable insights into the design and implementation of the system. Together, we refined the architecture, optimized the scraperâ€™s performance, and ensured that the platform was scalable. This collaboration was crucial in turning the idea into a working product.
