Hello! My name is Joseph Schady, and this blog is an exploration through my journey of creating a startup web scraping business. The original idea behind this project came to me during an internship at Gnosis Freight. While working there, I was introduced to the concept of web scraping data from platforms like SimilarWeb. This sparked my interest in developing a tool that could analyze similar data to help businesses gain a competitive edge. What started as an idea has now evolved into a full-fledged project, and I'm excited to share my journey with you through this blog series.
