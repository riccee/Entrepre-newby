After solidifying the idea, the next step was to design the architecture of the platform. I envisioned a system that could handle large volumes of data, process it efficiently, and present it in a user-friendly manner. Using tools like React for the front end and Quart for the back end, I began sketching out the architecture. Below is a diagram created using Excalidraw that showcases the overall structure of the project, including the different components and how they interact.
